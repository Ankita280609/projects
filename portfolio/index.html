                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am an 18-year-old computer science enthusiast from Patna, Bihar, with a keen interest in technology and innovation. Currently, 
                    I am diving into the world of CS/AI at Newton School of Technology, where I strive to challenge myself and explore new skills. 
                    I am passionate about continuous learning, whether it is mastering a programming language or refining my problem-solving approach.

                    I love cooking and experimenting with recipes, as it allows me to be creative and unwind from the demands of tech.
